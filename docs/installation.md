# Installation

## Stable release

*spaceprime* can be installed using `pip` or `conda`. Due to the package's reliance on `msprime`, the `pip` installation is only available on unix-based systems (MacOS, Linux). Windows users should install *spaceprime* using `conda`.

To install *spaceprime* using `pip`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install spaceprime
```

To install *spaceprime* using `conda`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge spaceprime
```

The `mamba` package manager can also be used to install *spaceprime* using `conda`. `mamba` tends to be much faster than conda. To install *spaceprime* using `mamba`, install `mamba`, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge spaceprime
```

## From source

To install spaceprime from source, run this command in your terminal:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/connor-french/spaceprime
```
