# Usage

To use spaceprime in a project:

```python
import spaceprime
```

To use the `analysis` module, which is imported separately from the main package to reduce the number of dependencies:

```python
from spaceprime import analysis
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to install the relevant analysis dependencies with `pip install spaceprime[analysis]` or `conda install -c conda-forge spaceprime[analysis]`.
